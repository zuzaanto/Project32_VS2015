# masm-graphics-editor
So maybe this will help someone, since there seems to be nothing much on Macro Assembly on the contemporary web...
This is a project I made as a WUT assignment. You can compile it using the make.bat folder. Many thanks to Kip Irvine and his masm32 library and set of examples.
This program is supposed to perform basic operations on bitmaps (dib files to be specific, .bmp). It provides a GUI to load and save images. 
The functionality is still WIP, it needs to be switched to operate on bitmaps buffors instead of pixels as-is. But it enables you to get a glimpse of how to initialize, display a bitmap and access its pixels respectively.
